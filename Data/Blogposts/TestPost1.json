They can often rummage through garbage cans, searching for tasty treats to munch on. But don\u0027t let their trashy habits fool you - raccoons are actually quite intelligent and resourceful animals.u\nOne of the fascinating things about raccoons is their paws.

They have fluffy, ringed tails and distinctive black and white masks that give them a playful, almost mischievous appearance. It\u0027s no wonder that they have become popular mascots and characters in children\u0027s books and movies.So the next time you see a raccoon rummaging through your trash, try to appreciate their playful spirit and clever ways.","PublishDate":"2022-05-02T20:46:09.7156866+02:00","Category":{"Id":"3f4f09e2-fafa-4fd1-87b8-ffc3994357ed","Name":"raccoon category"},"Tags":[{"Id":"TestTag1","Name":"Test tag 1"},{"Id":"TestTag2","Name":"Test tag 2"},{"Id":"650655be-74d8-4c9e-97d8-2a84f928f559","Name":"Raccoons"},{"Id":"10fd856f-4f57-4292-b52a-dfe07d5bcb2c","Name":"Raccoons"}]}
